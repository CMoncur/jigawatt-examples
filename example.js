This Jigawatt middleware function is given an ID as input data.
First, it ensures that the ID is only integers and lowercase
numbers, then ensures that is is the correct length to query the
database.

IO makes two calls to the database, one to gather the poll and
details, and the next to gather all responses to that poll, to
include data about the responder.

The poll will have a structure like this:

{ _id: 57f691081739bcb1144630a2,
  title: 'What is your favorite city?',
  creator_id: '1234',
  location: 'Las Vegas',
  location_type: 'City',
  private: false,
  __v: 0,
  questions:
   [ 'Juneau, Alaska',
     'Vladivostok, Russia',
     'Redding, California',
     'Wilmington, North Carolina',
     'Galveston, Texas' ] }

And the responses will be structured like this:

[ { _id: 57f69170526f05b5dbe4d035,
    poll_id: '57f691081739bcb1144630a2',
    user_id: '1111',
    answer: 1,
    private: false,
    __v: 0 },
  { _id: 57f691784949d5b68c337548,
    poll_id: '57f691081739bcb1144630a2',
    user_id: '1112',
    answer: 2,
    private: false,
    __v: 0 },

  ...
]

Lastly, transform will take the data collected by IO and format
it in a structure that we want.  In this case, we want to return
an object with a poll title and a list of response objects that
include cities and their respective votes:

{
	"poll": "What is your favorite city?",
	"results": [ { "Juneau": 2 }
             , { "Vladivostok": 3 }
             , { "Redding": 1	}
             , { "Wilmington": 0 }
             , { "Galveston": 2	}
             ]
}
